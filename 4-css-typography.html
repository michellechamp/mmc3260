            <h2>Student. Writer. Artist.</h2>
            <p>I'm Michelle and I'm a current journalism student at the University of Florida. I love writing, art and design, baking, blogging and exploring. </p>
            <p> I am originally from Argentina, born in the buzzing city of Buenos Aires. However, I was raised in southern California and brought over to Florida about six years ago, where I ended up at the University of Florida in Spring 2012. 
            <p>I am currently enrolled in UF's College of Journalism and Communications, where I have survived classes such as Reporting, Visual Journalism and Multimeda Reporting.</p>
            <p> I knew I wanted to enter journalism when I realized, as a little girl, that instead of just glossing over all my mom's vintage magazine, I could help create them. The idea of being a part of a collaboration like Vogue fascinated me (and still does).</p>
            <p>As I got older, I found myself doodling and painting on everything, much to my mother's dismay (sorry, walls). Art has always been a part of me, while writing grew to be a challenge I enjoyed doing. </p>
            <p>Now, deep into my journalism classes here, I've fallen in love with digital design. I hope one day I can merge my two life-long loves of art and writing through design and editing.</p>
            <p> I am so excited to see the journalism industry evolving and I hope I can be a part of the change.</p>
